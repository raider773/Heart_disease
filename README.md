# Heart_disease
Predicting if patient will have a heart disease

- The ultimate goal for this problem is to predict whether the observation has heart problems or not.
- See attributes.txt for more information of each feature.
- I'll divide the problem in different notebooks, first exploratory, then some feature engineering to add some features, then training the models and finally implementing the model in some way.
